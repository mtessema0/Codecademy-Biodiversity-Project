Plant Observations:

1. For all parks and for each park, find the average number of observations. Which park has the least average observations, and which has the most?

2. Which species have the most observations for each park? What about across all parks?

3. Which genus’ contain the most observations for each park.? What about across all parks?

4. Which genus’ appear most frequently (have the most unique species) and least frequently for each park? What about across all parks?

5. Create a function that compares the total number of species belonging to a genus for each park given the genus name.

6.  Create a function that compares the number of observations for each park given the genus name.



Animal Observations:


1. What is the average number of unique species per genus? What about across all genus’ ? What genus contains the most unique species? What about the least?

2. What is the average number of unique species per animal type? What about across all animal types ? What animal type contains the most unique species? What about the least?

3. Which animal types contain the highest number of unique genus’? Which contain the lowest and what is the average across all animal types?

4a. Compare conservation status across animal type(mammal, amphibian, etc)
4b. Calculate percentage of species under conservation for each animal type.
4c. Which genus’ contain the largest number of endangered species? 
4d. Create a function that returns highly endangered species (Threatened or Endangered) given genus name.
4f. Create a function that compares the most endangered species given animal type.
4g. Are differences between species and their conservation status statistically significant?
	


Goals:

Clean data (Drop duplicate rows, fill or drop missing data, organize columns)

Create visualization when appropriate.

Create functions when appropriate (typically to compare some variable given the genus or species name)

Apply hypothesis testing when necessary.
